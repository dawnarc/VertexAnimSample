# Overview

The reason why I created this project:

The example project [VertexAnimSample - Box.com](https://epicgames.box.com/s/qlzveuyov93p9a00gjbiftim1yy207ew) that was provided by official document ([Baking out vertex animation in editor with AnimToTexture](https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/daE9/unreal-engine-baking-out-vertex-animation-in-editor-with-animtotexture)) was obsolete, but Epic doesn't update the example, the Editor Utility Wdiget in the origin project can't be run properly.

This's an UE5 project to demonstrate VAT: Bake bone (SkeletalMesh) animation into Vertex Animation Texture, and play animation using material (the main work is running in vertex shader) of StaticMesh.
